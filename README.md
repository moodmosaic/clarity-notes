This repo contains some portion of notes, sketches, ideas etc. I collected over time.

Most of them were created while I was working with @whoabuddy on CityCoins project.

Security notes were taken while auditing, reporting, exploiting (I'm sorry again) and sometimes even fixing issues I have found in multiple projects such as (in no particular order) Crash Punks, Alex, Arkadiko, Stackswap, Byzantion, Catamaran Swap, Buy-MIA, StxNFT, stacksart, nft-nyc-exclusive (and large number of NFT contracts)

Execution costs notes are just a more organized form of different notes made while I was working on CityCoins and analyzing various contracts (especially those that were cause of network congestion).
There are plenty of small details that affects execution costs and they varies from contract to contract. Some are applicable some arent. What you find here are things that are applicable to 95% of all contracts I had a chance to look at.
